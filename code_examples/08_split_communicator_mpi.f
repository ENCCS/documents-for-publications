! Split the world communicator into subgroups of commu, each of which contains processes that run on the same node, and which can create a shared memory region (via the type MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED).! The call returns a new communicator "host_comm", which is created by each subgroup.  call MPI_COMM_SPLIT_TYPE(MPI_COMM_WORLD, MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED, 0, MPI_INFO_NULL, host_comm,ierr)call MPI_COMM_RANK(host_comm, host_rank,ierr)
