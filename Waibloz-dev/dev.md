## Contact information of the code developers



# Your connection to the code (e.g. developer, collaborator to main developers, etc.)
I am a user


# Scalability and performance

## Describe the scalability of the application and performance of the application



## What is the target for scalability and performance



# Optimization of the work proposed

## Explain how the optimization work proposed will contribute to future Tier-0 projects


## Describe the impact of the optimization work proposed - is the code widely used; can it be used for other research projects and in other research fields with minor modifications; would these modifications be easy to add to the main release of the software?


## Describe the main algorithms and how they have been implemented and parallelized


# Performance

## Main performance bottlenecks


## Describe possible solutions you have considered to improve the performance of the project



## Describe the application enabling/optimization work that needs to be performed to achieve the target performance
parallelize the code using MPI for multiple GPUs


## Which computational performance limitations do you wish to solve with this project
I think there is a typo in the end, i.e. the word "hav"


# Application Support Team (AST)

## Does your proposal require assistance from an AST on the selected partition(s)
yes


## Is your proposal a follow up of another submitted Epicure project to use EuroHPC quota for providing application support? 
No
